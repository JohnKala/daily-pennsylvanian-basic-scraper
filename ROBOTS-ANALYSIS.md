## Explanation

The `robots.txt` file explicitly allows all user agents (via `User-agent: *`) to access all pages (`Disallow:` is empty).  
This means we are ethically and legally permitted to scrape publicly accessible content on the site.  
We are scraping only the front-page headline, once daily, which is respectful of server load and complies with best practices.
